iFeedback
=========

Launch customer support e-mails directly from your app, pre-filled with critical information. 
Streamline troubleshooting by collection information the first time.

Do you ever receive user feedback from customers that lack details? "App doesn't work" or "App crashes, fix it please!"

Rather than spending hours on a long e-mail conversation trying to figure out what version of your app the user has, what device they are using, and which version of iOS they are using, just use this Framework to do the lifting for you.

Anytime you prompt the user to send a feedback e-mail, the e-mail will automatically include:

* App name
* App version
* User's device (e.g. iPhone 5, iPad 3)
* Device name
* iOS version
* User's language
* User's country code
* Carrier (e.g. AT&T)
* Screen resolution
* Device orientation
